## Summary

Perhaps the most gorgeous area in North America, the Canadian Rockies are protected by numerous national and provincial parks. I centered this map on the two most popular national parks, Banff and Jasper.

## Process

I used a combination of hillshades, aspect, and slope raster layers all blended together to make the shadows. I also exaggerated the 3D terrain by a factor of 3 to make the topography stand out. I tried to add 3D labels in ArcGIS Pro, but due to limitations I used Inkscape to add labels instead.
