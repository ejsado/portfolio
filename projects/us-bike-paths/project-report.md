## Summary

I always prefer riding my road bike on a designated bike path. Any sort of separation from traffic offers a huge increase in safety and makes the ride much more peaceful. **Where in the US has the most bike paths?**

## What defines a bike path?

> OpenStreetMap distinguishes between cycle lanes and cycle tracks. A cycle lane lies within the roadway itself (on-road), whereas a cycle track is separate from the road (off-road). Tracks are typically separated from the road by e.g. curbs, parking lots, grass verges, trees, etc.

These cycle tracks are the ones I’m interested in, and are tagged as “cycleways.”

Cycleways are not exclusive to bike riders, they are typically paved paths shared with pedestrians.
