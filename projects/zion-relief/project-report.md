## Summary

Southern Utah is a gorgeous place to explore. Just outside of Zion National Park is plenty of public land, miles of dirt roads, and really fantastic mountain biking trails. Usually, when people visit a national park, they tend to miss the surrounding gems. I wanted to show the larger area where Zion resides and all of the beautiful topography of the area.

## Process

I used a combination of hillshades, aspect, and slope raster layers all blended together to make the shadows. I also exaggerated the 3D terrain by a factor of 1.5 to make the topography stand out.
