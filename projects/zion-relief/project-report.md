## Summary

Southern Utah is a gorgeous place to explore. Just outside of Zion National Park is plenty of public land, miles of dirt roads, and really fantastic mountain biking trails. Usually, when people visit a national park, they tend to miss the surrounding gems. I wanted to show the larger area where Zion resides and all of the beautiful topography of the area.

## Process

I used a combination of hillshades, aspect, and slope raster layers all blended together to make the shadows. I also exaggerated the 3D terrain by a factor of 1.5 to make the topography stand out. I tried to add 3D labels in ArcGIS Pro, but due to limitations I used Inkscape to add labels instead.

## Notes on ArcGIS Pro

This project highlighted some of the limitations of ArcGIS Pro. It does a great job with 2D maps, allowing complicated labels and blending layers to achieve whatever effects you desire. However, 3D scenes are a different matter. Rendering is much slower (understandably) and label support is basically nonexistent. You can label map elements, but you canâ€™t put the labels where you want, defeating their purpose and any map usability/legibility. This [bug from 2016](https://support.esri.com/en/bugs/nimbus/QlVHLTAwMDA5MzcyNw==) explains that this has been a known issue for years. They do offer a [workaround](https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000021536)...

ArcGIS Pro also doesn't support extent indicators with 3D scenes. So, hopefully everyone knows where Utah is...
