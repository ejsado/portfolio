		<h2>
			About this Website
		</h2>
		<p>
			I built this website from scratch without the use of a CMS (like Wordpress) or templates. It minimizes the use of Javascript and maximizes the use of PHP.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each project description is saved as a Markdown file and parsed by PHP before being served, which eliminates the need for a database or CMS and still allows easy editing. This probably wouldn't be a good idea for a more traffic-intense website, but for my purposes it works fine.
