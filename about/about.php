        During my year-long road trip of 2019, I saw a lot of places. I explored mountains, deserts, rain forests, and grasslands, all while camping out of my truck. My love of the outdoors grew and I knew I had to somehow combine my experience with programming and design with my appreciation of nature.

        The field of Geographic Information Systems allows me to use my web development knowledge to display environmental data in a meaningful way. Iâ€™m able to utilize my programming ability to solve and automate complex problems with spatial data. Creating eye-pleasing and user-friendly maps comes natural to me as my design experience directly correlates with the principles of cartography. My skills are a perfect blend for GIS.
