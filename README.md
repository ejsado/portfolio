# Overview

This website relies on PHP and does not use a database or CMS to keep it lightweight. It also avoids unnecessary use of JavaScript. Most of it is coded from scratch, though it does rely on a few utilities. 

Each project is saved in a separate folder with a markdown file for the project description. When the project page is loaded, the markdown file is parsed by PHP. Markdown files are easy to read and edit in a text editor which allows me to avoid using Wordpress, Drupal, or other CMS which require a database.

The website is responsive and therefore desktop and mobile friendly. It was designed to scale at any resolution.
